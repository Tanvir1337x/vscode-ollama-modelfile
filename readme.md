## What is Ollama Modelfile?

A Modelfile is the blueprint to create and share models with Ollama. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/modelfile.md) and look at some examples [here](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main/examples). Moreover, you'll discover a variety of models on [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com).
