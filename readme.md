## What is Ollama Modelfile?

A Modelfile is the blueprint to create and share models with Ollama. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/blob/main/docs/modelfile.md) and look at some examples [here](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/tree/main/examples) and [my collection](https://github.com/TanvirOnGH/AI_workspace/tree/main/ollama/modelfiles).
